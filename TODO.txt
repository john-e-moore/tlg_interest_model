* Bugs
 * Securities that get added onto are not correctly summing for years before they
   get reissued.
 * Yearly payments starts to flatten out, but I think this makes sense because
   the jump is due to jump in interest rate. Why doesn't Chris' flatten out?
   I must have a faulty assumption programmed in?
* Change to fiscal year instead of calendar year.
* Split code into modules (utils, simulate_reissuance, calculate_interest_payments)
* Use API + Lambda function to download new data monthly. Pass 'Fields' parameter.
